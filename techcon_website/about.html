            <h2>The TechCon Evolution</h2>
            <div>
                TechCon started in 2018 with a simple goal: to create a hub for tech enthusiasts in Nairobi. Since then,
                it's grown into Africa's leading technology event, drawing thousands and top minds worldwide. Our
                journey has been about constantly adapting to the fast-paced tech world and building a strong community
                of innovators. From our beginnings, TechCon has consistently been a place for big ideas and teamwork,
                proving its importance in Africa's tech development.
