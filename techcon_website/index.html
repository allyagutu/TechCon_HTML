            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <div>
                TechCon began in 2018 as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts in Nairobi, driven by the vision to
                create a platform for African innovation. Over the years, it has grown into the continent's largest
                technology conference, attracting thousands of attendees and influential figures from around the globe.
                Our journey has been marked by continuous evolution, adapting to the dynamic tech landscape and
                fostering a vibrant community of innovators. From humble beginnings, TechCon has consistently provided a
                stage for groundbreaking ideas and collaborative opportunities, solidifying its reputation as a
                cornerstone of technological advancement in Africa.
